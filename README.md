<h3>Contribution guidelines:</h3>
<p>
If you are contributing in languages other than c++, kindly follow the rules:
make sure you create a folder name "language_name ex-python/java/javascript/any_other_language_that_youre_using" and then make sure you put the file name in the following order "QNo.xyz_problem.py","QNo.xyz_problem.jar","QNo.xyz_problem.js" etc example :
"20.ValidParanthesis.py","20.ValidParanthesis.jar", "20.ValidParanthesis.js"
Once done kindly update the README.md file by updating the Problems : by adding your code name format : "QNo.xyz_problem [Easy/Medium/Hard] [C++/Python/Java/Language You are using]" 
if youre using c++ its great simply add it here : in the main repo:
"QNo.xyz_problem.cpp" ex "20.ValidParanthesis.cpp".
Once done kindly update the README.md file by updating the Problems : by adding your code name format : "QNo.xyz_problem [Easy/Medium/Hard] [C++/Python/Java/Language You are using]"
