Here is the full line by line explaination for the approach used.

Intuituion : 
       1. Find the normal max sum of the linear subarrray using Kadanes Algorithm.
       2. Use the logic of subracting the min subarray sum from the entire total sum.
       3. Then adding the total sum - min subarray sum 
       4. Return the max of the linear vs non linear sum 

Complexity :
   
      Time : O(N)
      Space : O(N)
